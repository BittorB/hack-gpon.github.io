The OMCI is defined such that vendors can offer modular, incremental capabilities to meet different 
levels of customer needs. This Recommendation defines a protocol necessary to support capabilities 
specified in the relevant PON specifications, as well as a variety of services and features. The OMCI 
supports interoperability, yet it allows for optional components and future extensions.
A protocol-independent MIB (Management Information Base) describes the exchange of information across the OMCI[^G_988].

The protocol-independent MIB presented in this Recommendation is defined in terms of MEs. MEs 
are abstract representations of resources and services in an ONU. Only a small subset of the list of 
MEs is mandatory. The existence of other MEs depends on the architecture and feature set supported 
by the vendor[^G_988].
